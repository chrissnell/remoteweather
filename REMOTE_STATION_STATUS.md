# Remote Station Implementation Status

## Current Status Summary for Remote Station Implementation

### Completed Work:

#### 1. Protobuf definitions (`/protocols/remoteweather/remoteweather.proto`):
- Added `RegisterRemoteStation` RPC
- Added `station_id` field to `WeatherReading`
- Added `RemoteStationConfig` and `RegistrationAck` messages

#### 2. Database migrations:
- Created `remote_stations` table for central server (migration 016)
- Added `station_id` to `storage_configs` for remote stations (migration 017)
- Updated database bootstrapper in `pkg/config/provider_sqlite.go`

#### 3. Remote Station Registry (`/internal/weatherstations/grpcreceiver/registry.go`):
- Implemented in-memory caching with SQLite persistence
- Only updates last_seen in memory to avoid DB hits on every reading
- Loads existing stations on startup
- Handles registration with UUID generation

#### 4. gRPC Receiver Updates (`/internal/weatherstations/grpcreceiver/station.go`):
- Added `RegisterRemoteStation` RPC handler
- Integrated registry initialization with SQLite database
- Modified `SendWeatherReadings` to track station_id
- Added database access through config provider chain

#### 5. Config Provider Updates:
- Added `GetDB()` method to `SQLiteProvider`
- Added `GetUnderlying()` method to `CachedConfigProvider`
- Created `RemoteStationProvider` wrapper to make remote stations appear as virtual devices to controllers

### Completed Work (Phase 6):
**Created gRPC client storage backend** in `internal/storage/grpcstream`:
- ✅ Created `client.go` - Client connects to central server via gRPC
- ✅ Implements registration with service configurations from device config
- ✅ Persists station UUID in SQLite database via config provider
- ✅ Sends readings with station_id
- ✅ Handles reconnection with exponential backoff
- ✅ Created `conversion.go` - Converts between internal types and protobuf
- ✅ Fixed redundant config storage in Station struct

### Design Decisions:
- Remote stations appear as virtual devices to existing controllers
- No manual configuration needed on central server
- Remote stations use SQLite for UUID persistence (not files)
- Controllers automatically pick up and forward remote station data
- In-memory last_seen tracking only (no DB queries per reading)
- Service forwarding happens automatically through virtual device pattern
- Using standard database connection, caching layer handles frequent queries

### Completed Work (Phase 7):

#### Phase 7: Add /api/remote-stations endpoint
- ✅ Created REST endpoint at `/api/remote-stations`
- ✅ Added `GetRemoteStations` handler in `handlers.go`
- ✅ Returns station configurations with last_seen timestamps
- ✅ Includes online/offline/stale status based on last_seen
- ✅ Restricted to portal websites only
- ✅ Updated registry to use config provider instead of direct DB access

#### Phase 8: Add Remote Stations tab to Management UI
- Display registered remote stations
- Show last heard timestamps
- Display service configurations

- `/Users/cjs/dev/remoteweather/pkg/config/remote_stations.go` (NEW)
- `/Users/cjs/dev/remoteweather/internal/storage/grpcstream/client.go` (NEW)
- `/Users/cjs/dev/remoteweather/internal/storage/grpcstream/conversion.go` (NEW)
- `/Users/cjs/dev/remoteweather/internal/controllers/restserver/handlers.go` (MODIFIED - added GetRemoteStations)
- `/Users/cjs/dev/remoteweather/internal/controllers/restserver/controller.go` (MODIFIED - added route)

### Implementation Notes:
- The gRPC receiver initializes the registry by accessing the SQLite database through: `CachedConfigProvider -> SQLiteProvider -> GetDB()`
- Remote stations table stores all service configurations as columns (not JSON)
- The RemoteStationProvider wraps the config provider to inject remote stations as virtual devices
- Controllers (APRS, WeatherUnderground, etc.) automatically see remote stations as regular devices

### Current Compilation Status:
✅ Project compiles successfully without errors

### Next Step:
Implement the gRPC client storage backend in `internal/storage/grpcstream/client.go` that will:
1. Load or generate station UUID from SQLite
2. Connect to central gRPC server
3. Register with service configurations
4. Stream readings with station_id
